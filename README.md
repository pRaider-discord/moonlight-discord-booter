API REQUIRED




when u put ur api link you need to put it in exactly how the order is for your api link ||||| ^^^ api_link is referring to config.json      
basically if your api link was this: https://skidbooter.net/1.1.1.1/60/udp/80, you would put api_link as https://skidbooter.net/{ip}/{time}/{method}/{port}

thanks for using
